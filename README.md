 <h1>Vulnerability Management Home Lab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab we will cover vulnerability scanning and vulnerability remediation. These are two of the main steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. We will be using Nessus Essentials to scan local VMs hosted on VMWare Workstation in order run credentialed scans to discover vulnerabilities, remediate some of the vulnerabilities, then perform a rescan to verify remediation.
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>PowerShell</b> 
- <b>Diskpart</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<br />
If the scan is saved, we will be able to see the scan you created in the My Scans table. Start the Scan by hitting the Launch button indicated in the screen shot below:  <br/>

Once the scan is completed, click on the name of the scan. This will bring us to the the results of the scan for us to further inspect:  <br/>
